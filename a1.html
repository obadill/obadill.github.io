                For both the Green and Red LED schematics, they are connected
                to their respective pins (pins 13 and 12), each through a 200-ohm
                resistor. With a voltage drop of 1.8 V due to their LED color type,
                160 ohms is required. The closest standard resistor value is 200
                ohms, which provides some additional leeway.

                For the Blue LED schematic, it is connected to pin 11 on the Arduino.
                With a larger voltage drop compared to the green and red LEDs (3.3 V),
                the required resistance must be recalculated. Since the blue LED
                consumes more energy, the resistor has less voltage to dissipate.
                Using Ohm's law, it is determined that 85 ohms of resistance is
                needed. The closest resistor available in our kit is 100 ohms,
                which will suffice and provide some additional cushion.

            Q2: How many LEDs could you blink independently with your Arduino?
            How much current would that draw?

              If the LEDs run independently and sequentially, as they do in the
              current setup, the current is allocated to one LED at a time. In
              this case, the number of LEDs you can blink is limited by the number
              of GPIO ports, which is 14 on the Arduino UNO (or 15 if you include
              the 5V port, though it wouldnâ€™t blink). Making the total current
              draw to still be 0.20mA.
              <br><br>
              However, if multiple LEDs were running at the same time, more current
              would need to be allocated. Referring to the ATmega328P datasheet
              used in the Elegoo Arduino UNO R3, the total current limit for the
              VCC and GND pins, which essentially powers and run the entire
              microcontroller, is 200 mA. Since each LED typically draws 20 mA,
              a total of 10 LEDs could be powered at the same time, with each LED
              running independently. Going past this limit could damage the
              microcontroller permanently.

            Q3: How fast do you need to blink your LEDs until you no longer can
            tell that they are blinking?

            <article>
              For me, when tweaking the timer and reducing it in increments of 1,
              I found that I could still make out the blinks at 4 milliseconds.
              However, as soon as I brought the timer to 3 milliseconds, the
              blinking appeared completely still as it blinks so fast
              that I could no longer process the changes in the LEDs brightness.
