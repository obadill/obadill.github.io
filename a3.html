                The White LED has a voltage drop of 3.3V. Since the White LED
                requires more power, the resistance is lower, as shown in the
                calculations, which only require 85 ohms of resistance. However,
                we use the closest resistor value available, which is the
                100-ohm resistor.

                order to always receive a constant source of power for the photoresistor,
                which is then read via an analog pin inside the voltage divider. As we are

              In the voltage divider circuit, the measured voltage changes depending on the state of
              the photoresistor. When the light is off, the servo is at angle 0, and the voltage at
              the divider is 0.40V as measured with a multimeter. When the light is on, the servo moves
              to angle 180, and the voltage at the divider increases to 4.42V. These readings demonstrate
              the circuit's response to the photoresistor's role in controlling the voltage divider output
              and dynamically adjusting the servo's position based on light conditions. Additionally,
              when there is no light on the photoresistor, the LED is on, and when light is present,
              the LED turns off, providing visual feedback that complements the servo's motion.

            of a servo motor and the brightness of two LEDs on a breadboard based on the photoresistor's readings.

            error. Additionally, an LED is dynamically turned on whenever the photoresistor's readings reach the
            calibrated maximum sensor value.

          The chosen pin value for the servo (pin 5) corresponds to its PWM capability, which is
          ssential for controlling the servo's position. The analog pin A0 is used because it’s
          where the photoresistor is connected, allowing the circuit to read variable resistance
          values as analog inputs.
          <br><br>
          The timer and errorMargin are user-specified values. The timer is set to a duration of
          (500ms) to ensure there is enough time for user input, such as adjusting light conditions
          during calibration, enabling the program to determine accurate sensorMin and sensorMax
          values. Without this delay, the program would complete calibration too quickly, potentially
          resulting in incorrect min/max values. The errorMargin sets a threshold for detecting
          significant deviations in sensor readings, triggering recalibration only when necessary.
          <br><br>
          The constrain() function ensures that the current sensor value remains within the calibrated
          range, preventing unexpected outlier values from affecting the servo’s behavior. After
          constraining, the map() function scales the sensor value to the servo's angle range (0–180 degrees),
          where 0 represents the servo’s minimum position and 180 represents its maximum position.
          <br><br>
          The servo output logic is straightforward: the servo’s position is dynamically adjusted b
          ased on the mapped value from the photoresistor’s readings. This ensures the servo responds
          smoothly to changes in light levels, demonstrating a clear relationship between the photoresistor
          input and the servo's motion.
          <br><br>
          Additionally, the white LED (pin 6) dynamically adjusts its brightness based on the
          photoresistor's readings, with lower light levels resulting in higher brightness and vice versa.
          This visual feedback complements the servo's movement, enhancing the circuit's overall
          responsiveness to changes in light conditions.

              After examining both scenarios, we can see that the variable resistor can be either
              R1 or R2. However, the inner workings of how the circuit functions will change. As we
              see in scenario #1, as lux increases, so does V_out, which is the output observed when
              using a multimeter in the currently made circuit. Inversely, if we placed the variable
              resistor in the R2 spot, we could expect the opposite to occur: as lux decreases,
              V_out will increase.

            Q3: AnalogWrite and analogRead are respectively 8-bit and 10-bit values. Imagine you had
            10-bit PWM and a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter instead. How would this change your
            map() code? Explain your answer.
          </h4>
          <div class="questionsInner">
            <article>
              If we had a 10-bit PWM and a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC), the map()
              function would now need to account for the new ranges of both input and output. Currently,
              AnalogWrite outputs an 8-bit PWM signal with a range of 0–255, and AnalogRead uses a
              10-bit ADC with a range of 0–1023. With a 10-bit PWM, the output range would increase
              to 0–1023, and with a 16-bit ADC, the input range would expand to 0–65535.
              <br><br>
              Now making the map() function map the 16-bit input range (e.g., sensorMin to sensorMax)
              to the 10-bit output range of 0–1023. This would change the code to something like
              map(sensorValue, sensorMin, sensorMax, 1023, 0) to match the updated resolution. These
              would improve both reading values and smoother transitions when writing PWM signals, as
              the increased bit depth would provide better control over both input and output.
