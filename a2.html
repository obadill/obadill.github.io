                For both the Red and Yellow LED schematics, they are connected
                to their respective pins (pins 12 and 13), each with a 220-ohm
                resistor. Given the known voltage drop for their color, which is
                1.8V, 160 ohms of resistance is required. However, the closest
                standard resistor value available is 220 ohms, so it is used.

                Opposite to the Yellow and Red LEDs, the White LED has a voltage
                drop of 3.3V. Since the White LED requires more power, the
                resistance is lower, as shown in the calculations, which only
                require 85 ohms of resistance. However, similar to the previous
                LEDs, we use the closest resistor value available, which is
                the 100-ohm resistor.

                The button, being the newest component for this assignment, does
                not have a voltage drop like the LEDs. However, we use a 10,000-ohm
                resistor instead, ensuring the circuit is both safe but also efficient
                when it comes to battery peservation.

            run if powered by a 1200 mAh battery?

              When considering this question, I considered two scenarios based on
              whether the button is pressed continuously or not. In my circuit,
              there is always at least one LED on. If the white LED remains on
              the entire time, the battery would last approximately 70.59 hours.
              When the button is pressed, the red and yellow LEDs dim at a level
              set in the software (130 in my case), which reduces their current
              draw. If the button were held continuously, the battery life
              increases to around 84.15 hours, giving about 14 extra hours.
              While other scenarios, such as intervals of button presses, could
              be calculated, this provides a good range for estimating the
              battery life.
